My name is Aman Priyanshu; I am an incoming Master's Student\nat Carnegie Mellon University for Privacy Engineering. My research\ninterests include Privacy Preserving Machine Learning, Explainable\nAI, Fairness, and AI for Social Good. I have recently focused on\nareas such as Prompt Engineering, Reinforcement Learning, Causal\nInference, and Bias Mitigation. During my undergraduate studies, I\nwas recognized as an AAAI Undergraduate Scholar (2023) for my\ncontributions to the field of Fairness and Privacy. Additionally, I have\nhad the opportunity to gain practical experience through internships,\nincluding working as a Privacy Engineer Intern at Eder Labs R&D\nPrivate Limited, a MITACS Research Intern at Concordia University,\nand as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Manipal Institute of\nTechnology.\nI have been published in various machine intelligence and security\nfields and have won awards for my projects. I have also applied\nmy research to developing applications for social good during\nhackathons. I aim to pursue a doctoral degree after completing my\nundergraduate studies. If you'd like to reach out to me, please feel\nfree to contact me through LinkedIn.\nTake a look at my GitHub (https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu). \nI also have a blog which I update with short articles: (https://\nchaiwithpy.github.io/)\nExperience\nMyCelium Sports\nFounding Member & AI-Lead (Course: 11-681)\nJanuary 2024\u00a0-\u00a0May 2024\u00a0 (5 months)\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nNERDA-Con: Extending NER\nmodels for Continual Learning\n\u2014 Integrating Distinct Tasks and\nUpdating over Distribution Shifts\nThe Silent Curriculum: How Does\nLLM Monoculture Shape Educational\nContent and Its Accessibility?\nFinding an elite feature for (D)DoS\nfast detection\u2014Mixed methods\nresearch\nEfficient Hyperparameter\nOptimization for Differentially Private\nDeep Learning\nWhen Differential Privacy Meets\nInterpretability: A Case StudySpearheaded the development of an AI-powered Sports Content Creation\nEngine, reducing video editing time by an impressive 20x and enabling the\ngeneration of highlights from hour-long game footage for basketball and\nfootball in just 2 minutes, contributing to a $100/monthly subscription with 3\npaid customers and an LOI of $7.2k.
